# üöÄ 10 JavaScript Concepts That Made Me a Top 1% Developer

The difference between an average developer and an expert isn't just experience‚Äîit's how deeply you understand the language. This repository compiles the core JavaScript concepts that transformed my approach to coding and helped me reach the top 1% in the field. Mastering these concepts can make a huge difference in the quality, performance, and maintainability of your code.

## üî• Key Concepts to Master

### 1. **Execution Context & Call Stack**
   - Once you truly understand how JavaScript executes your code, debugging becomes effortless.
   - The call stack plays a central role in the execution flow of JavaScript, helping you trace and debug your code.

### 2. **Event Loop & Microtasks**
   - Ever wondered why `setTimeout(() => console.log("Hi"), 0)` isn‚Äôt instant? Understanding the event loop and microtasks is the key.
   - These concepts explain how asynchronous code is executed and how JavaScript handles concurrency.

### 3. **Prototype & Prototypal Inheritance**
   - Understanding this unlocks the true power of JavaScript‚Äôs object system.
   - Prototypes are the foundation of object inheritance in JavaScript, and mastering this concept can elevate your object-oriented skills.

### 4. **Closures & Lexical Scope**
   - Closures are why React‚Äôs `useState` works and how private variables are made possible.
   - Learn how closures and lexical scoping allow JavaScript to retain access to variables even after their execution context is gone.

### 5. **Hoisting**
   - It‚Äôs not just about "lifting variables up"‚Äîthere‚Äôs a whole execution phase behind it.
   - Hoisting can cause unexpected behavior if not understood properly. Dive into how it works behind the scenes.

### 6. **this Keyword & Binding**
   - Mastering `this` means you‚Äôll never be confused by its behavior in arrow vs. regular functions again.
   - Understand how `this` is determined in various contexts, like inside methods, callbacks, and event handlers.

### 7. **Currying & Partial Application**
   - If you‚Äôre not using these techniques, you‚Äôre writing more code than you need to.
   - Currying and partial application allow you to write cleaner, more flexible code, especially when working with functional programming concepts.

### 8. **WeakMap & WeakSet**
   - These data structures help store data without memory leaks.
   - Use `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` when you need to manage references to objects in a way that does not prevent garbage collection.

### 9. **Debouncing & Throttling**
   - Handling scroll, input, or resize events without these techniques? You're doing it wrong.
   - Learn how to optimize performance by controlling the frequency of function execution in response to high-frequency events.

### 10. **Symbols & Hidden Properties**
   - Create true privacy in JavaScript objects‚Äîno more `_private` hacks.
   - Symbols provide a way to create unique, non-enumerable properties on objects, ensuring their integrity.
